            <br>
            <p><b>Tutankhamun,</b><a href="a">[a]</a> commonly referred to as <b>King Tut</b>, was an <a href="a">ancient Egyptian pharaoh</a> who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the <a href="a">18th Dynasty</a> (ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC in the <a href="a">conventional chronology</a>) during the<a href="a"> New Kingdom </a>of<a href="a"> Egyptian history</a>. His father is believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten, identified as the mummy found in the tomb KV55. His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as "The Younger Lady" who was found in <a href="a">KV35.[9]</a><br><br>
            Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. He married his paternal half-sister <a href="a">Ankhesenamun</a>. During their marriage they lost <a href="a">two daughters</a>, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term.[10] His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean "Living image of Aten" and "Living image of Amun", with Aten replaced by <a href="a">Amun</a> after Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be incorrect and closer to "The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as "One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten".<br><br>
            Tutankhamun restored the <a href="a">Ancient Egyptian religion</a> after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the <a href="a">Valley of the Kings</a> and relocated the capital from <a href="a">Akhetaten back to <a href="a">Thebes</a>. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the</a> use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb. He had other health issues including <a href="a">scoliosis</a> and had contracted several strains of malaria.</p>

                Tutankhamun, whose original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, was born during the reign of Akhenaten, during the late <a href="a">Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.[12]</a> Akhenaten'sreign was characterized by a dramatic shift in ancient Egyptian religion, known as Atenism, and the relocation of the capital to the site of<a href="a"> Amarna</a> , which gave its name to the modern term for this era, the Amarna Period.[13] Toward the end of the Amarna Period, two other pharaohs appear in the record who were apparently Akhenaten's co-regents: <a href="a"> Neferneferuaten</a>, a female ruler who may have been Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti or his daughter Meritaten; and Smenkhkare, whom some Egyptologists believe was the same person as Neferneferuaten but most regard as a distinct figure.[14] It is uncertain whether Smenkhkare's reign outlasted Akhenaten's, whereas Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten's death and to have reigned for some time after it.[15]
